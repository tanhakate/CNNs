# Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for Video Emotion Recognition

There is an undercurrent of emotion throughout the learning process. In this paper, we summarized secondary-literature findings concerning the importance of emotion in an academic settings and prior attempts at facial recognition and introduced a development plan for fully automatic real-time emotion recognition using CNNs, with details of our algorithm and a preview of the interface design.
